This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in React Native involving the `useCallback` hook. The bug arises when `useCallback` is used with a function that depends on a state variable that updates frequently.  The memoized function retains a reference to the old state, leading to unexpected behavior. This repository includes example code showcasing the bug, along with a clear solution.  The solution demonstrates proper handling of dependencies in `useCallback` to resolve the issue.
