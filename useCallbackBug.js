This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that depends on a state variable that changes frequently.  The `useCallback` hook memoizes the function, preventing unnecessary re-renders, but if the memoized function still references a state variable that changes every render, the memoized function may not behave as expected. This is because the memoized function still holds a reference to the old state value from when it was created.
