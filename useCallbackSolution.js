The solution involves restructuring your code to ensure that the callback function's dependencies are properly managed. Instead of directly referencing the state variable within the callback, you can use the current value of the state variable within the callback function. This ensures the callback uses the most up-to-date state.  Another technique to resolve this error is to use the `useRef` hook, which can hold a mutable value that won't trigger re-renders when updated. This allows for updating values without causing unnecessary re-renders of the component.
